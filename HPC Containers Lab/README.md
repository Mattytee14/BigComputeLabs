# Azure HPC Containers Lab
* Microsoft EMEA Big Compute (HPC) Team - <mailto:EMEAGBBBigComputeTSP @ microsoft.com>
* Initial versions by Karl Podesta, February 2018

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1  The Lab
This is a technical lab to help you get started with containers for HPC on Azure. We will focus on using Singularity containers, a popular containerisation technology for HPC. We will explore the use of Singularity containers with VMs on Azure (i.e. standard IaaS), together with more advanced (i.e. PaaS) discussion.   

Please share any thoughts, feedback, or improvements - this is a work in progress, and we want to make sure it helps you to get started in the right way with using Azure for HPC container workloads!
